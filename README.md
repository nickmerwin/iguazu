## What?

Dropbox managed Ruby On Rails (Or maybe Sinatra; I haven't yet decided)
Photo-Gallery site.

## Why?

A few reasons:

9. Give my mother an easy way to create and manage her own photo-gallery site
   without leaving the desktop paradigm she is used to. (Look, big words!)

9. Try and create a ruby web-app that
   [Uncle Bob](http://confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years "'Architecture, the lost years' Presentation")
   and [Jim Gay](http:http://clean-ruby.com/ "'Clean Ruby' Book homepage")
   would not kill me for making.

## Status

Exceedingly early state, totally non-functional, this is not the ready-to-go
site you are looking for.

## Install

When I know, I will let you know.
