## Contributing

Development is trying to stick to principles talked about in the book
"Clean Ruby" and various presentations by Bob Martin regarding good software 
design. 

Therefore if you want to contribute please stick to the following rules.

* Follow the principles talked about in the book "Clean Ruby"
* Watch and learn from this [presentation](http://confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years "'Architecture, the lost years' Presentation") by Bob Martin
* If there isn't a test for it then the code cannot be written. Follow TDD.
* Isolate your tests as much as possible and keep them fast!
* Before commiting run tests with warnings enabled and make sure none are 
  generated by Iguazu itself. (You can do this with rake spec:warning)
* Create your new features in a branch and open a pull request when ready
* Follow git commit message [guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)


Although the main aim for this application focuses on Dropbox and Amazon
if you want to add other clients for other services or options then go ahead.

This is as much a learning process for me as anything else so if anyone else
wants to join in the more the merrier.

Personally I am developing at a tiny fraction of my usual speed because of all
the thinking I am doing on how to write this thing.
